# Deployment Assets Moved

All Docker, Compose, and deployment assets now live at the repository root:

- `/.env.example`
- `/docker-compose.yml`
- `/docker/`
- `/deploy/`

Please follow the instructions in the root-level `README` and `deploy/` directory.

> This folder is kept for backward compatibility only. Existing scripts and Compose files were removed during the refactor in favour of the new root deployment toolchain.
