Read the current git changes using:

- git diff --stat
- git diff

Based on the actual changes, generate:

1. BRANCH_NAME
   • kebab-case
   • concise
   • prefix with "auto/"
   • max length 40 chars
   • no spaces, only [a-z0-9-]

2. PR_TITLE
   • clean, capitalized short summary of the change

3. PR_BODY
   • 3–6 bullet points summarizing the changes
   • use $'...\n...' syntax for multiline

Then output a single command that sets all three variables and runs:

./auto-pr-core.sh

Format must be exactly:

BRANCH_NAME="..." PR_TITLE="..." PR_BODY=$'....' ./auto-pr-core.sh

Do NOT ask me questions.
Do NOT explain anything.
Just generate and execute the command.
